## The project

We developed hypotheses based on global energy production and consumption data, spanning from 1900 to 2024, available at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). Below is the work structure:

* `data`: contains the .cvs file with the raw data.
* `plots`: contais the final visualizations produced.
* `src`: contains the Python scripts, including functions for data cleaning and graph plotting.
* `main`: calls the functions from the other modules to run the analysis.
* `requirements`: Lists the necessary dependencies and their versions for running the analysis.
